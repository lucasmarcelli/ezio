            Despite all the work he does, Ezio Marcelli is a father and grandfather before anything else. He loves his family more than anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            He has made countless sacrifices throughout his life in the interest of his family and children. He moved across the ocean to Canada without his wife or the ability to speak English. He gave up his art and worked and worked until his wife Sandra could join him so they could get their family to where it is today.  He now has two sons and two grandchildren he adores and continues to make daily sacrifices for them. Neither of his children would be where they are today without him.
