            Ezio Marcelli studied Fine Art near his hometown of Chiaiamari, Italy in Frosinone. Ezio gave up his career as an Artist when he moved to Canada in order to better provide for his family in his new home.

            His usual style of art is a stunning abstract representation of various forms. A single painting of his can take months depending on the size due to his precise methods that require significant planning and attention to detail. More recently he has
            expanded his medium in creating an amazing lifelike portrait of his wife Sandra.
